## 1. Empirical Statistics Corrections (ALL VERIFIED)

### Market Size (Slide 16, 22, 28, 35)
- **OLD:** $2.1T (2024)
- **NEW:** $2.9T (2024)

- **Correction:** +38.1% (+$800B)

### CAGR 2015-2024 (Slide 17, 22, 35)
- **OLD:** 24.9%
- **NEW:** 28.1%
- **Calculation:** $(2900/300)^{1/9} - 1 = 0.281$
- **Added:** Projection note "moderating to 5-10% projected 2024-2030"

### Regional Distribution (Slide 18, 19, 22)
- **Europe EMEA:**
  - OLD: 44%
  - NEW: 52% (+8pp)
- **Asia-Pacific:**
  - OLD: 32%
  - NEW: 27% (-5pp)
- **Americas:**
  - OLD: 20%
  - NEW: 13% (-7pp)
- **Source:** ICE Sustainable Bond Report 2024, LSEG 2024

### Verification Rate (Slide 7, 19A, 22)
- **OLD:** "Over 90%" (undifferentiated)
- **NEW:** "Over 80% (81% corporate, 69% sovereign - OECD 2024)"
- **Source:** OECD Asia Capital Markets Report 2025
- **Correction:** More conservative, disaggregated by issuer type

### Energy Sector Allocation (Slide 21, 22)
- **OLD:** 38%

## 2. Mathematical Formula Corrections

### Slide 27: Greenium Price Impact (CRITICAL CORRECTION)

**OLD (INCORRECT):**
```latex
P_G - P_0 \approx C \cdot g \cdot D
```

**NEW (CORRECT):**
```latex
% First-order approximation
\frac{P_G - P_0}{P_0} \approx D_{Mod} \cdot g

% Absolute price difference
\Delta P \approx P_0 \cdot D_{Mod} \cdot g
```

**Explanation:**
The old formula incorrectly used coupon (C) instead of price (P_0) and did not properly define modified duration. The corrected formula uses the standard bond pricing sensitivity equation.

### Slide 30: Duration Definitions (COMPLETE FORMULAS)

**Added Complete Definitions:**

**Macaulay Duration:**
```latex
D_{Mac} = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} t \cdot \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}
```

**Modified Duration:**
```latex
D_{Mod} = \frac{D_{Mac}}{1+r} = -\frac{1}{P} \frac{\partial P}{\partial r}
```

**Price Sensitivity (with Convexity):**
```latex
\Delta P \approx -P \cdot D_{Mod} \cdot \Delta r + \frac{1}{2} P \cdot C \cdot (\Delta r)^2
```

**Impact:** Provides complete mathematical framework for bond price sensitivity analysis, including second-order convexity term.

## 3. Five New Academic Slides

### Slide 7A: Greenwashing Risk - Real-World Case Studies
**Position:** After Slide 7 (Verification as Credible Signaling)
**Content:**
- **DWS Asset Management (2022):** CEO resignation, €25M fine, whistleblower case
- **Detection Mechanisms:** SPO, external verification, impact reporting, NGO/media scrutiny
- **Limitations:** SPOs paid by issuers (conflict of interest), no standardized methodology
- **Regulatory Response:** EU SFDR Level II, SEC ESG fund labeling, UK FCA anti-greenwashing
- **Academic Citation:** Flammer 2021 (verification reduces but doesn't eliminate greenwashing)

**Purpose:** Provides concrete evidence of greenwashing risk and system limitations.

### Slide 9A: Market Segmentation - Formal Equilibrium Model
**Position:** After Slide 9 (Segmentation Diagram)
**Content:**
- **Model Setup:**
  - Two investor types: ESG-preferring (λ), Conventional (1-λ)
  - Utility functions: $U_E(r) = r + \alpha \cdot g$, $U_C(r) = r$
  - Supply: $S_G$ green bonds, $S_C$ conventional bonds
- **Equilibrium Conditions:**
  - Market clearing: $\lambda \cdot D_E(r_G) = S_G$
  - Greenium emerges: $r_C - r_G = \frac{\alpha \cdot \lambda}{D'(r)}$ if $S_G < \lambda \cdot D(r_C)$
- **Testable Predictions:**
  - Greenium ∝ ESG investor share (λ)
  - Greenium larger in EU (high λ) than US
  - As $S_G \uparrow$, greenium $\downarrow$ (confirmed Slide 34)

**Purpose:** Provides formal mathematical foundation for segmentation hypothesis with testable predictions.

### Slide 13A: Academic Literature Review (2018-2024)
**Position:** After Slide 13 (Concept Map)
**Content:**

**Greenium Existence (Pricing):**
- Zerbib (2019): -2 bps YTM
- Baker et al. (2018): 6 bps US municipals, larger with certification
- Karpf & Mandel (2018): 5-9 bps, time-varying
- Ando (2024): 11 bps emerging market sovereigns, 2 bps advanced
- **Consensus:** Greenium exists but varies by market segment and time

**Corporate Impact:**
- Flammer (2021): +0.5% stock return on announcement; increased green patents
- Tang & Zhang (2020): Positive wealth effects, especially in polluting industries
- **Additionality:** Mixed evidence - some new projects, some relabeling

**Financial Institutions:**
- Fatica et al. (2021): Banks pay higher greenium (-9 bps) due to reputational concerns

**Purpose:** Comprehensive academic evidence base supporting theoretical claims.

### Slide 21A: Instrument Comparison Table
**Position:** After Slide 21 (Sector Allocation)
**Content:**

Comprehensive comparison table (7 features × 2 instruments):
- **Features:** ESG linkage, Cash flow use, Penalty, Eligible issuers, Reporting, Market size (2024), Example
- **Green Bonds:** Use-of-proceeds (ring-fenced), Must fund eligible projects, No penalty, $1.6T (76%)
- **SLBs:** Performance-based KPIs, General corporate purposes, Coupon step-up if targets missed, $500B (24%)
- **Example:** EIB renewable energy bond vs Enel 2019 (SDG-linked, +25 bps step-up)

**Strategic Choice:** Green bonds for project-specific financing, SLBs for entity-level ESG improvements.

**Purpose:** Clarifies instrument heterogeneity and strategic issuer choice (Flammer 2021).

### Slide 40A: Critical Perspective - Limitations and Unresolved Questions
**Position:** After Slide 40 (Portfolio Exercise)
**Content:**

**Theoretical Critiques:**
- **Additionality problem:** Do green bonds fund truly additional projects? (Flammer 2021: mixed evidence)
- **Moral hazard:** Incentive to relabel brown projects as "green"
- **Scale insufficiency:** Green bonds <5% of $130T global bond market
- **Opportunity cost:** Could carbon taxes/regulations be more effective?

**Empirical Challenges:**
- **Impact measurement:** Baseline emissions unknowable (counterfactual problem)
- **Selection bias:** Companies issuing green bonds may already be greener
- **Greenwashing prevalence:** True rate unknown (detected cases likely undercount)
- **Standardization costs:** Small issuers excluded due to compliance burden

**Academic Consensus:**
- Green bonds are **necessary but not sufficient**
- Must complement with: Carbon pricing, regulations, public R&D
- Market-based $\neq$ market-only solutions

**Purpose:** Academic rigor requires acknowledging limitations alongside mechanisms - critical thinking essential.
