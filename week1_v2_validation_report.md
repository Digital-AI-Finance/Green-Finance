## Student Experience Comparison

### v1.0 Student Experience:
```
1. Read 4 learning objectives (never see them again)
2. Go through 4 sessions
   - "Introduction" - ok, general overview
   - "Ecosystem" - participants and flows
   - "Instruments" - bond types
   - "Fundamentals" - some finance concepts
3. End of week - not sure what was important
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ No clear narrative
- ❌ Don't know what to focus on
- ❌ No self-assessment
- ❌ Objectives forgotten after slide 1

   - Now I know what I'm learning
   - 9 slides on theory (asymmetry, signaling, segmentation)
   - Ends with summary: "Can you explain greenium using theory?"
   - Self-check: Yes! I understand the WHY

3. Session 2 starts with:
   "LEARNING GOAL 2: Quantify and analyze market..."
   - Ok, now measuring what we theorized
   - Charts showing $2.1T market, 25% CAGR
   - Calculate growth rates myself
   - Summary: "Can you calculate CAGR?" Yes!

4. Session 3 starts with:
   "LEARNING GOAL 3: Derive pricing models"
   - Now the HOW TO value
   - See step-by-step math derivation
   - Apply formula to examples
   - Summary integrates all 3 goals

5. End of week:
   - I mastered 3 specific goals
