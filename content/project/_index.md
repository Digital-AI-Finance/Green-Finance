## Project Rationale

Climate change negatively impacts ASEAN countries, particularly the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. These nations are implementing ambitious reforms to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and green economic transformation.

**The Challenge:** Higher education in the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam lacks the capacity to provide green finance skills crucial for the green transition. ASEAN needs $210 billion annually for green transition, but the lack of technical capacity and skills undermines implementation.

**The Solution:** The GREEN FINANCE project aims to modernize higher education by:
- Developing innovative curricula structured as micro-credentials
- Adopting practice-based teaching methods aligned with European Green Deal principles
- Equipping graduates with essential competencies for a net-zero economy
